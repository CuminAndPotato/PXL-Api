- Docu:
    Disallow using "real" Promises, but instead use the async state-aware helpers ('usePromise')
- Support iterations and conditionals (for, if, while, switch)
- Detect more false-use cases (e.g. prepare: pop / push not undefined)
- streamline color / Paint stuff
- clarify the semantics of the 'flush' function
    (fire + forget / buffered)
    ..also relate the semantics of the behaviour of RenderCtx
- we should definitely buffer some frames to not have "ruckeln" in the animations
